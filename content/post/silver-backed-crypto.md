I am going to start this off by saying that I am 100% a Silverbug. I love the shiny metal and I honestly think silver is one of the greatest buys a blue collar man could put their hard working money into. I have to say that upfront because I am going to argue against a Silver backed (or anything for that matter) cryptocurrency. 

The other day at soccer practice, three of us dads were just sitting around shooting the shit, talking about politics, kids, the good ol' days, and eventually the subject of crypto came up. One of that dads mentioned that he was interested in alt coins but only the silver backed alts. That was news to me that there was such a thing. I had heard talk about silver and gold backed cryptos, but was totally unaware that one had actually been launched.  

I'm not on board with any crypto that is tied to any physical asset that is intentioned to be a currency. Why? Counter party risk. 

When you have any currency that is backed by any physical commodity, the temptation by the custodian to be 100% honest about the holdings or to not inflate the asset through issuing new currency, is far to great a risk. Sure maybe not in the short run and not by the founder visionaries. They probably share the same values as the holders. However over time, when the visionaries retire and new people take over, their motives become different than the visionaries. 

One argument against the above is that they could simply mathematically limit the supply so that the currency never becomes inflated. But if that is the case, then what purpose does having the asset backed currency actually achieve? It makes more sense to just own that asset outright and leave out the middleman.  

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which has a fixed supply of 21M, is mathematically deflationary, cannot be counterfeited, cannot be inflated, achieves all the goals of a commodity backed currency, but with none of the risks. Which is why a true modern currency, something that you use to trade for goods and services, should no longer be a commodity.
