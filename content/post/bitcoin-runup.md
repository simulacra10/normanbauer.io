So here we are at another Bitcoin pop. As of this writing BTC is making newsworthy highs ($11,601 on Coinbase). The runup started on Sunday, July 26th and has continued all week. 

Back in February, BTC started rising getting over $10k then crashed all the way down to $3700. At the time when it started breaching $10k I thought it was premature for the bull run and damned if I wasn't right. 

This time I have been keeping my eye on it with the expectation that we have started the next bull run. If my timing is correct (and I think it is) this is it. Let me tell you why.

In October of 2018 I was just about to pull the plug on BTC . It just wasn't going anywhere. I moved everything into BTC and then moved it from the exchanges to Coinbase to move into cash. My thinking was at the time to move into mining stocks. I had anticipated a runup in mining stocks starting in 2019 (little did I know that it would be the very next week in 2018 that their moves would begin to break out). However before I hit the sell button I wanted to be sure one last time that it was the right move. 

I opened up the historical chart from the beginning and glanced at it. It took me a few minutes but I noticed a pattern that up until that time no one I had ever talked to had mentioned. The pattern I saw was the boom-bust cycle of Bitcoin. 

If you open any chart that shows the all data from the Genesis Coin until present day you are going to see a patter where the price of BTC in USD goes up 90% from its previous high, then it falls all the way down just near but never touching the previous bust high. In October of 2018 we were closing in on the next cycle. The cycle itself revolves around the halving, which at the time was going to happen sometime in June of 2020.
