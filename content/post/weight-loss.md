At my heaviest (the photo of me in the upper left corner) I weighed in at 227 lbs. I was stuffing myself into size 36 jeans and they were getting rather tight. 

I was having trouble breathing. Walking up the stairs would wind me. Doing anything physical for that matter took the wind and energy out of me. My joints were killing me and at night I could get no peace because my weight was putting stress on my hips because I sleep on my side. Oh and my snoring from what my wife tells me was deafening. 

Then one day while on the YouTubes I came across this video below of Dr McDougall. This video saved me. It saved me from poisoning myself the rest of my life. He introduced me to a vegan lifestyle.
