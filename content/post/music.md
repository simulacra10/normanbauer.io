This October my daughter and I will be attending the Iron Maiden: Legacy of The Beast tour. Maiden has been my #1 band of all time since I was in middle school. Songs like Infinite Dreams (hell the entire Seventh Son of a Seventh Son album for that matter) has gotten me through tough times in my life.
