When I was coming of age (a time before the Internet) the most dynamic content was found on AM & Shortwave radio. Talk radio was king to me in large part because you could get details about the hot topic of the day from the perspective of the average Joe instead of something that was packaged and sold by a News Anchor Editor.

By far my favorite time of year to listen to the local talk shows was Christmas. Specifically in the few days just before New Year because nearly all the channels had some sort of year in review round table discussion. Usually with several of the local talk show hosts on the panel. 

I enjoyed the banter but I also enjoyed reviewing the year's major events. So it is with all of those episodes in mind that I decided in January of 2020 to keep track of the major stories of interest to me and do a year in review in writing. This is that attempt. 

Let's get Covid out of the way first by stating up front that I will not be talking about that. That is a saga that has hogged the headlines all year long and has overshadowed some other events that should have been front in center. I will not be mentioning covid below unless it is for context.



## Science and Tech

#### Elon Musk

Perhaps the most interesting events of 2020 to me had to do with Elon Musk. The bad news, Tesla announced that it was going to change the long awaited and controversial Cybertruck. I was really looking forward to seeing the prototype design drive down the street.  Mr Musk also made possible the historic launch of the SpaceX Dragon module that docked with the International Space Station. 

As if that was not enough, SpaceX has been launching satellites for Starlink. Starlink has been in beta testing and hopefully will open to the public in 2021. Starlink now has 895 pizza box sized satellites in orbit, with a goal to encompass the planet with high-speed satellite internet service, bringing the internet to the masses. 



## Cryptocurrency

If you had been a Facebook friend of mine or followed me in Twitter OR knew me in person, you would know that back in 2018 I said 2019/2020 would be the beginning of the next bull run for Bitcoin. In October of 2018 I was long on gold and silver mining stocks. I thought they were at their absolute lowest and would start to climb. Bitcoin in 2018 was near its low and I was giving serious consideration to selling all of my crypto and putting it all in mining stock. However taking a step back and analyzing $BTC I quickly realized that that would be a foolish move and that not only should I not sell, I should be buying. 

Looking at the charts revealed that Bitcoin was going to enter a bull run sometime around August/September of 2020 or near that time just after the next halving. And just as predicted, the bull run started in September. BTC slowly broke $8k, then $10k, then $15k, and on Decemeber 16th, 2020 exactly three years to the day of the bubble pop, Bitcoin breached it's all time high of $20,089. As of this writing it broke $28k and I suspect that it probably reacy $30k before Jan 1, 20201 (just a few days away). 

The down side to this is that altcoin season is delayed. Bitcoin's market cap has been hovering between 69-70% which means the alts are going to be stagnate for a while. I am seriously looking forward to 2021. The 2017 run up to $20k was super exciting. The run this time may cause heart attacks. I see $100k easily and if institutional demand keeps this pace, $300k-$400k per BTC is possible.  

## Phones

2020 should be dubbed "The Year of 5G" as 5G was finally rolled out to the general public by the end of the summer. 5G promised super fast Internet access and it did not fail to deliver on that promise. 

The first phone brought to me with 5G enabled had 24 updates available for the phone. When I clicked on the "Update All" button in the Play Store, it downloaded all 24 in under 30 seconds. 

The iPhone 12 was release and this is phone is without doubt the best iPhone yet. The camera and LIDR sensor make pictures in all light stunning. However it is not the camera that makes this phone exceptional. It is the introduction of front and rear glass made by Corning that is truly remarkable. While the glass is not indestructible, it is super strong and can withstand drops from atop a 6 foot ladder. As someone who makes his living off of replacing the cracked glass on iPhones, I should not be this excited about it as it stands to put a major damper in my business. However as a technology advocate, it makes me giddy.  

## Deaths

This year was a tough year. Death has touched every family and always does (it is the one constant after all); however some truly remarkable people passed away this year. Some have left behind legacies that will last millennia.
