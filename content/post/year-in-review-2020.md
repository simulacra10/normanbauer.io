When I was coming of age (a time before the Internet) the most dynamic content was found on AM & Shortwave radio. Talk radio was king to me in large part because you could get details about the hot topic of the day from the perspective of the average Joe instead of something that was packaged and sold by a News Anchor Editor.

By far my favorite time of year to listen to the local talk shows was Christmas. Specifically in the few days just before New Year because nearly all the channels had some sort of year in review round table discussion. Usually with several of the local talk show hosts on the panel. 

I enjoyed the banter but I also enjoyed reviewing the year's major events. So it is with all of those episodes in mind that I decided in January of 2020 to keep track of the major stories of interest to me and do a year in review in writing. This is that attempt. 

Let's get Covid out of the way first by stating up front that I will not be talking about that. That is a saga that has hogged the headlines all year long and has overshadowed some other events that should have been front in center. 

Elon Musk

Perhaps the most interesting events of 2020 to me had to do with Elon Musk. The bad news, Tesla announced that it was going to change the long awaited and controversial Cybertruck. I was really looking forward to seeing the prototype design.

## Cryptocurrency

If you had been a Facebook friend of mine or followed me in Twitter OR knew me in person, you would know that back in 2018 I said 2019/2020 would be the beginning of the next bull run for Bitcoin. In October of 2018 I was long on gold and silver mining stocks. I thought they were at their absolute lowest and would start to climb. Bitcoin in 2018 was near its low and I was giving seriouse consideration to selling all of my crypto and putting it all in mining stock. 


Phones

2020 should be dubbed "The Year of 5G" as 5G was finally rolled out to the general public by the end of the summer. 5G promised super fast Internet access and it did not fail to deliver on that promise. 

The first phone brought to me with 5G enabled had 24 updates available for the phone. When I clicked on the "Update All" buttoin in the Play Store, it downloaded all 24 in under 30 seconds.
