I recently stepped into the middle of a conversation between two friends. They were talking about the vaccines, the side effects, and whether or not there is a conspiracy behind them. As proof of a conspiracy, one of my friends related an interview with a virologist on a TV show they watched who predicts that there will be mass deaths in five years - because of the vaccine. That begs the question, will there be massive deaths in five years? And will they be from the COVID vaccine?

Not being a doctor, scientist, or having any credentials to support my position, I say the virologist is right and wrong. To understand that making the claim that there will be mass deaths in 5 years, you just need one bit of information. Boomers (people born between 1946-1964) are retiring at the rate of 10,000 a day starting last year. That trend will continue for the next 14 years. At its peak they will retire at a rate of 15,000 a day. 

With that in mind, predicting that there will be mass deaths in the future is an accurate and easy prediction. The cause on the other hand is not necessarily accurate. Simply by the numbers and the actuarials, starting in 2027 most of the Boomers will be turning 72 years old. Regardless of the cause of death, just making it to 72 is itself a reason to expect mass deaths.
