The new broke to me about three days ago that Mozilla has finally thrown their hat into [the VPN ring](https://vpn.mozilla.org/). Yea!!!!

A few years ago Mozilla found itself in the unique position as the only alternative browser to Google Chrome other then Apple's Safari. Opera had dropped their rendering engine in 2013 (Called Presto) in favor of Google Chrome's Blink rendering engine. Internet Explorer was abandoned by Microsoft and rebuilt from scratch with Google Chrome's Blink and rebranded as Edge. Which left only three major rendering engines, WebKit (Apple), Blink (Google), and Gecko (Mozilla). 

Somewhere along the way the great people at Mozilla figured out that privacy and security were really important to quite a few users. The transition from Google's "Don't be evil" motto to the present day "We are just another evil arm of the State" had not gone unnoticed. Mozilla capitalized on this and started to shift their focus from being a user centric browser to a privacy and security centric browser.

Myself, I had stopped using anything but Google Chrome since the day the beta was released. It was fast and I loved the way that tabs were handled and how it had a very clean interface. But I also had noticed the creepy change at Google and it concerned me deeply as well. 

I don't recall the date but I know it was at least 5 years ago that my concerns were elevated enough that I switched back to Firefox as my fulltime browser. Since that time Mozilla has introduced containers, adblocking, encrypted DNS lookups, and more. So the move into the space of VPN's is a natural move (you can read about it [here](https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2020/06/18/introducing-firefox-private-network-vpns-official-product-the-mozilla-vpn/) in their announcement).

For VPN I have been using [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/wyeoakmobile) for the last few years and I highly recommend it. I'll still be using PIA for the foreseeable future because Mozilla VPN is not on my platform yet (Linux and iOS); however when it does come to those platforms I am going to try it for sure. 

Also, when it comes to VPN's, knowing what your VPN provider logs and does not log is of the utmost importance. For that reason alone is why I do not use anyone else other than PIA. Thankfully Mozilla has the same focus as PIA:

> "The Mozilla VPN runs on a global network of servers powered by [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/help/no-logging-data-policy/) using the [WireGuard](https://mullvad.net/help/why-wireguard/)Â® protocol. Mullvad puts your privacy first and does not keep logs of any kind." 

Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope that your future visits to my site are from Firefox and are secured through a VPN.



God bless!
