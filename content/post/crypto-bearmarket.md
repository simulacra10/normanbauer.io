I have been on the sidelines of the crypto market licking my wounds from loosing my ass off in 2020. It was not a fun year. 

The biggest lesson I learned is that margin trading is poison. Marging trading is for degenerate gamblers (so is day trading). I am not a gambler. I've never been good at gambling on anything and have always thought of it as a waste of time, money, and energy. 

That being said I have spent the past two years learning more and discovering market patterns and I think I have found the hidden knowledge.

# LONGING & SHORTING

I have found that in terms of momentum you can think of longing analogouse to going uphill. It's a slow going up. Shorting is like going downhill, it moves fast. When markets fall it happens very quickly, sometimes over a period of just a few minutes. 

# What is SHORTING?

For me, it took a while for me to understand what shorting was. I found that most explanations were confusing. 

The easiest way to think of shorting is that you are going to temporarily borrow something. Once you are finished with it, you are returning that something to the owner. What you did with it in the time you had it, you get to keep. 

Let's say that you see an opportunity to short Bitcoin. In other words you think the price is going to go down. First you borrow a Bitcoin. You then immediately sell that Bitcoin in the market. 

So now Bitcoin goes down to a price that you think is the bottom. You now buy back Bitcoin at the new lower price and then return it to the lender. The price difference between when you sold the Bitcoin on the market and then bought it back again is your profit. All you had to do was borrow the Bitcoin and return it when you were done. That is shorting in a nutshell. 

## Contrarian Trading

Let's talk some strategy. How do we best take advantage of our new found knowledge.  

As I said earlier, margin trading is poison. However there is a caviot emptor to that. Margin trading can be a great tool when you know how to use it to your advantage. 

Doing what we were doing, using it to day trade, is a fools errand for 99% of the traders out there. When you are looking at small time frames like 1M, 5M, 15M, 1H and so on, you are not seeing the picture. Because of that whales are going to manipulate your positions to their favor. Don't let the whales manipulate you and your positions! Become a Contrarian Trader. 

If you have a look at the chart I provided, you'll see the RSI on the Bottom and BTCUSDT on the candles. On The RSI indicator I have circles. One is green and the other is red. Each are marked buy and sell respectively. 

Here is what you want to do. When the market is crashing and CryptoTwitter and CryptoYouTube are going crazy. There is much weeping and whaling and nashing of teeth, that is the time to YOU are looking to enter into the market. Whether is it Bitcoin, stocks, whatever you are interested in that you can margin. 

When the RSI drops below 30 on the 1D candle, look to take out a reasonable 2.5 to 5x LONG margin position.

Reason #1 - interest rates are as low as they are ever going to be because few people are buying and fewer are borrowing. 

Reasont #2 - Your downside potential is very low and your upside is very, very high. With a 5x margin position you have room for about a 20% drop before you start getting warnings about an impending margin call. 

When the market enters into an over sold (RSI under 30) state, what are the chances that it drops another 20%? Near zero. It can and has dropped. Sometimes as much as another wick into 10% before rebounding. However, up it will go. Over the coming days or even weeks, your profits start soaring. Now it is time to look for an exit and make even more money.
