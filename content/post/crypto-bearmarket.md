I have been on the sidelines of the crypto market licking my wounds from loosing my ass off in 2020. It was not a fun year. 

The biggest lesson I learned is that margin trading is poison. Marging trading is for degenerate gamblers (so is day trading). I am not a gambler. I've never been good at gambling on anything and have always thought of it as a waste of time, money, and energy. 

That being said I have spent the past two years learning more and discovering market patterns and I think I have found the hidden knowledge.

# LONGING & SHORTING

I have found that in terms of momentum you can think of longing analogouse to going uphill. It's a slow going up. Shorting is like going downhill, it moves fast. When markets fall it happens very quickly, sometimes over a period of just a few minutes. 

# What is SHORTING?

For me, it took a while for me to understand what shorting was. I found that most explanations were confusing. 

The easiest way to think of shorting is that you are going to temporarily borrow something. Once you are finished with it, you are returning that something to the owner. What you did with it in the time you had it, you get to keep. 

Let's say that you see an opportunity to short Bitcoin. In other words you think the price is going to go down. First you borrow a Bitcoin. You then immediately sell that Bitcoin in the market. 

So now Bitcoin goes down to a price that you think is the bottom. You now buy back Bitcoin at the new lower price and then return it to the lender. The price difference between when you sold the Bitcoin on the market and then bought it back again is your profit. All you had to do was borrow the Bitcoin and return it when you were done. That is shorting in a nutshell.
