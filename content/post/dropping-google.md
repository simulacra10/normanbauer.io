![Evil Google](/img/google-logo-devil.jpg)

When Google was a small and rising star, long before they went public. When Eric Schmidt and Sergey Brin started the company with the motto "Don't be evil", I was a huge fan. While I am not smart, talented, or credentialed enough to work there; I must confess that for the longest time I desired to. 

Then something happened. Google went public and soon afterwards they dropped the motto and became the very thing they eschewed in their former motto. They became evil. 

I am not here to go over the history of how they got there. However it happened, they are no longer the good guys. As such, I have been moving away from their services whenever I can. I hope to be completely Google free by years end. 

One of the ways I have chosen to free myself from Google is by not using their analytics. Instead I have chosen [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/D1UL78) for analytics. As the old saying goes, "if something is free then you are the product". With Google Analytics, you and your visitors are their product. By continuing to use Google's analytics you expose your visitors to data leaks and capturing personal information that neither of you likely agreed to. 

[Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/D1UL78) on the other hand is a paid, private service. They do not collect any personal information, just the anonymous data that you need. For a low monthly fee, you can install [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/D1UL78) on unlimited sites and track traffic. They email you once a week with an update on traffic and you can email your clients with just their stats automatically too. 

Here are just a few reasons why you might dig [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/D1UL78)  too!

- You don't need to display those pesky cookie notices as they don't use cookies, nor do they track invasive data.
- They offer simple, straight-forward website analytics.
- They are focused on privacy for website visitors, they don't  track them, save their personal information, or need it to be  profitable.
- They have hundreds of customers and track tens of millions of  page views per month, so they may be a small company, but they're doing big  things.
- They can handle viral content without breaking a sweat, so  your site won't slow down because of them, and they don't ever stop tracking you because of a spike in popularity.
- They've been featured in Fast Company as a great alternative to Google Analytics.
- All of their plans allow for unlimited websites to be tracked and receive their top-notch customer support. And it is really top-notch!
