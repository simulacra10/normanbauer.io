I think that when we face hard times and ask God for a miricle and it does not happen or at least in our timeframe, some of us might be tempted to lose faith a little. I'm not saying it is always that way, but I do understand the sentiment. But what about when someone loses faith and then asks for a miricle and it is granted? what does that say about the nature of God?

I am one of those wicked wretches who has had his moments of doubt and had turned away from the faith. Midn you not to the poit of becoming a total reprobate. No, just one who stopped going to Mass and basically gave up on Christ. However something happened recently. God started to make moves in my life that I can not ignore. 

First came an invitation to a Bible study. It is a small group that meets at the home of a friend. While there has not been much study of Scripture as of yet, that is ok. We opne with prayer and hearts lifted up to the Lord and then begin conversation. We go where the Spirit leads us.
