Lo those many years ago when I started developing websites (in the late 90's early 2000's) and was learning HTML, the concept of a blog had not come together yet. If you wanted to post to the Internet you had four options. One post to a UseNet, two find a BBS forum, three send an email to all your friends, or four create a website and edit it by hand for each post. There were some other options like building a dynamic site with PERL (Unix was still dominate then and Hotmail was run on Unix and not owned by Microsoft then). 

Then along comes PHP. PHP was a much more approachable language than PERL so it caught on quickly and easily became the dominate programming language of the web. Eventually things like the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, & PHP) stack came together and pretty soon nearly every dynamic site you came in contact with ran was running PHP.  PHP was awesome in its time and in my humble opinion was the key programming language that led to the web we know now. Without PHP I do not think that the dynamic web would have been possible. 

From PHP and the LAMP stack came WordPress and Content Management Systems (CMS)
