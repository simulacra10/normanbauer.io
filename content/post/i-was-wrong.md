Sometime in the summer of 2019 I had a conversation with a conservative friend of mine about the state to the economy and where I thought it might go by 2021. He thought that the economy was turning around under Trump and I knew it was tanking. The only question at the time was what it was going to look like and how soon would the collapse be. 

Reading the tea leaves, at the time I said there was going to be a collapse in real estate again and that it was going to be a major one where it was likely to wipe out half the appraised value of homes, eventually. So we made a bet on that. We wagered that whoever was wrong by a certain date would buy the other a dinner. 

While this is premature, I am going to say that it looks like I will likely be the loser of the bet.
