It's not clear to me who is running Google anymore. Google has decided  to [purge](https://lwn.net/Articles/827233/) two programming language groups. comp.lang.forth & comp.lang.lisp

Of importance to me is the purge of Lisp. Lisp is one of the oldest programming languages. My favorite editor [Emacs](https://github.com/simulacra10/emacs) is written in a fork of Lisp (elisp).  Contrary to what the twenty somethings at Google may think, lisp is still used today. However more important than the fact that it is still used is the historical value the threads themselves provide. 

I can understand closing a group that has not had posts in some time. But for heavens sake at least archive it. Deleting it serves no purpose. It's not like the archive would be eating into their storage capacity.
