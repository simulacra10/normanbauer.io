When the first Chromecast came out, I was excited to get it. At $35 it offered a better experience with streaming Netflix than my Samsung smart TV. However even the Chromcast would buffer on occasion which was my chief complaint with using the Smart TV. 

A few years after I bought the Chromecast, I got my hands on a used Xbox 360. To many peoples surprise, I am not a gamer. I never have been. Whenever I have free time, the last thing I want to do is waste it playing games. I'd rathe spend it on that other major time sink aka. Social Media. Ha! 

The Xbox was fantastic for streaming! It had an internal hard drive and plenty of RAM which solved the buffering problem that drive me nuts with Chromecast and the smart tv. However the Xbox had some problems of its own. 

For one thing there were only a handful of select apps for streaming media. You had the basics - Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and YouTube. There were others like The CW Network, ABC, and the likes, but you things like TubiTV , Sling, or my personal favorite now, Pluto.tv were not available. I kind of think of it like having over the air TV when all your friends had cable TV. 

In the last two years I have now owned an Apple TV 3rd Gen, Apple TV 4k, and a Roku Ultimate. I'd like to talk a little about them here and share my experience with them. 

### Apple TV 3rd Gen

This was my first foray into streaming media players. 

##### Likes

The first thing to strike me about the Apple TV 3rd Gen was its size. Just shy of 4" square and 0.9" think, it is tiny and thus takes up very little space. Boot times are reasonable, maybe 20 seconds from power off to menu. I never had a problem with the performance of the device or streaming ever. 

Unfortunately, that's about all the good I can say for it.

##### Dislikes

While the performance was great, the remote was the absolute worst thing about the Apple TV 3rd gen. To start with it is way to small and thin. It is reminiscent of the iPod Mini only half as wide. Also, it was made from aluminum so the dam thing is slippery as hell. Because of its small size it was also easy to misplace. It's not uncommon to spend 20 minutes rifling through the couch cushions, looking underneath the couch, and ottoman, passing over it several times before finally you see it. 

Just as one can expect, Apple does not let you down with ceasing to support an otherwise capable device. What I mean is that, apps like the AMC streaming app are not available for Apple TV 3rd Gen and below. So if you are like me and want to cut the cord for cable, you'll have to upgrade to a newer model if you don't want to miss watching The Walking Dead or Better Call Saul. 



### Roku Ultimate

##### Likes

While not much bigger then the Apple TV, the Roku Ultimate completely delivers on everything where Apple fails. I fell in love with the Roku the moment I took it out of the box. 

The first thing that grabs you is the remote. It's just the right size. It has quick access buttons to Netflix, Hulu, Sling, and VUDO right on the remote. More important than that, the remote has an RCA headphone jack built into it. Which as you can imagine is extremely handy for those of us who are slightly hard of hearing or when you are streaming in your bedroom and your spouse wants to fall asleep. You put the headphones into the remote, and viola, you are in business. 

The availability of apps (or Channels as they are referred to) seems endless. You get everything I have mentioned thus far and a lot more. Classic Cartoon Channel, Western Channel, Classic Movie Channel, and so on. There is something for everyone.

##### Dislikes

The Roku is not without a flaw though. The one nagging problem that persists for me is that every few days the audio gets choppy. Like it is running out of memory. A quick disconnect from power and then plugging it in fixes the problem for a couple more days, but still it is annoying. Hopefully there is an update that fixes the issue.
