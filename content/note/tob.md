"Love consists of a commitment which limits one's freedom - it is a giving of the self, and to give oneself means just that: to limit one's freedom on behalf of another. Limitation if one's freedom might seem to be something negative or unpleasant, but love makes it a positive, joyful and creative thing. Freedom exists for the sake of love... Man longs for love more than for freedom- freedom is the means and love is the end." - - Wojtyla and Kant p.41 - T.O.B.

Gen 2:18 - Man's Solitude - Solitude has two meanings: one deriving from man's very nature, that is, from his humanity,... and the other deriving from the relationship between male and female. - p.147 

"It is not good that man should be alone" - God "tests" man by bringing him all the animals to be named. Through this test man gains the consciousness of his own superiority - that he can not be put on par with any other species of living beings on earth. 

.. above all to express, through a first self-definition, his own self-knowledge as the first and fundamental manifestation of humanity.
