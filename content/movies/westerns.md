Just like my [Classic Horror Movies List]('movies/classic-horror/') Westerns are another genere that I love. I tend to like more modern Westerns like Young Guns (which is not on the list for some reason), Django Unchained, and Wyatt Earp. However there are some gems in the original Westerns so I am going to be watching them. 

Going down the list I was surprised at just how many I had already watched. I guess it is one of those generas that creeps up on you if you are of certain age. 

If the status is "All quiet on the Western Front" I have not seen it and if it is "I'm your huckleberry" I have watched it.
