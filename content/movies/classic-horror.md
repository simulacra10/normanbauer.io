I have been a fan of the classic horror genre for a long time. Franenstein, Dracula, and so on. Surprisngly to me I have only watched a couple of the Universal movies. What I have watched the most of is the Public Domain horror classics. 

Wanting to keep a record of what I have watched and keep track of it, I thought a spreadsheet would be good. So I found a list of 100 Univerdal Horror films and did a webscrape using Python, to dump them into a CSV that I could then import into Excell and start tracking. While I was there I thought why not dump it into JSON & YAML at that same time and then I could share the list on my blog as well. 

The part that I thought was going to be the easiest turned out to be the most annoying, getting the data into Hugo. I will give that it's own post later as well as spruce this page up a bit more.

You can grab the code on my [Github repository](https://github.com/simulacra10/mgm-movies) to track your own.
