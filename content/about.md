My name is Norman Bauer. I am the owner of [Wye Oak Mobile Device Repair](https://wyeoakmobiledevice.repair) and [Wye Oak Business Solutions](https://wyeoak.info).

I have many interests such as my wife & our kids (2 girls), outdoors stuff, canning, long term food storage, cryptocurrency, precious metals, Austrian Economics, libertarianism, agorism, the US Constitution, electronics, programming, computer repair, virtualization, Linux, Linux Containers, networking, books, UFO's, music, radio's (CB, AM, Shortwave, and some HAM stuff too), and a lot more. I'll likely touch on all of these and more here. 

I am also a privacy advocate. I believe as the founders of the United States did, that privacy is a fundamental Right. Which is why this blog is a actually a static site instead of a WordPress or other CMS site. For the same reason you will not find Google Analtics of Facebook Pixel on this site. 

I do not need to know who visits this website, just how many and which pages they stay on the longest so I know better what content is liked by you, the reader.

To do this I pay for [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) for my analytics. From Fathoim's FAQ:

"Why isn’t Fathom free like Google Analytics?

If you aren’t paying for a product, you are the product. That’s why Google Analytics is free, because they make enough money off the personal data their customers give them by using their analytics service.

We charge a small and fair fee for Fathom, because our business model is selling software, not data (these very different business models). Our customers gladly pay for our service because they know their data is safe with us and their visitors' privacy is protected."

Thank you for visiting.

Norm
