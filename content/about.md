My name is Norman Bauer. I am the owner of [Wye Oak Mobile Device Repair](https://wyeoakmobiledevice.repair) and [Wye Oak Business Solutions](https://wyeoak.info).

I have many interests such as, my wife & our kids (2 girls), outdoors stuff, canning, long term food storage, cryptocurrency, presciouse metals, Austrian Economomics, libertarinism, agorism, the US Constitution, electronics, programming, computer repair, virtualization, Linux, Linux Containers, networking, books, UFO's, music, radio's (CB, AM, Shortwave, and some HAM stuff too), and a lot more. 

I'll likely touch on all of these and more here.
