      <description>I was watching the biographical movie Karol: A Man Who Became Pope for the 100th time recently. If you have not watched or heard of this movie, even if you are not Catholic, you should take some time to watch it. I promise that you will not be disappointed.
The movie is about Karol Wojtyla who eventually became Pope John Paul II.
In the movie there is a scene where Karol and his life-long friend Hanna have met at an abandoned castle in the country side; presumbly to speak in private away from the Nazi Police.</description>
