      <description>Praying the Rosary from USCCB
Familiarize yourself and/or your group with the prayers of the rosary.
 Make the Sign of the Cross. Holding the Crucifix, say the Apostles&amp;rsquo; Creed. On the first bead, say an Our Father. Say one Hail Mary on each of the next three beads. Say the Glory Be For each of the five decades, announce the Mystery (perhaps followed by a brief reading from Scripture) then say the Our Father.</description>
