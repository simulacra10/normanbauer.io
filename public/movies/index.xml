      <description>Just like my Classic Horror Movies List Westerns are another genere that I love. I tend to like more modern Westerns like Young Guns (which is not on the list for some reason), Django Unchained, and Wyatt Earp. However there are some gems in the original Westerns so I am going to be watching them.
Going down the list I was surprised at just how many I had already watched. I guess it is one of those generas that creeps up on you if you are of certain age.</description>

      <description>I have been a fan of the classic horror genre for a long time. Franenstein, Dracula, and so on. Surprisngly to me I have only watched a couple of the Universal movies. What I have watched the most of is the Public Domain horror classics.
Wanting to keep a record of what I have watched and keep track of it, I thought a spreadsheet would be good. So I found a list of 100 Univerdal Horror films and did a webscrape using Python, to dump them into a CSV that I could then import into Excell and start tracking.</description>
