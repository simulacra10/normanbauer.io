      <description>I have been a fan of the classic horror genre for a long time. Franenstein, Dracula, and so on. Surprisngly to me I have only watched a couple of the Universal movies. What I have watched the most of is the Public Domain horror classics.
Wanting to keep a record of what I have watched and keep track of it, I thought a spreadsheet would be good. So I found a list of 100 Univerdal Horror films and did a webscrape using Python, to dump them into a CSV that I could then import into Excell and start tracking.</description>
