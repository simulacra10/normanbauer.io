      <description>Today is all about Cardano ($ADA)!
Trading on Coinbase Pro starts at 9AM PST (12PM EST) from there this could be very wild ride to the top. There is some analysis out there that shows a possible run up to $3.50. But to be realistic, there is also analysis out there that shows it could only go to at most $1.86. Both projections were based on the last two coins to be listed on Coinbase Pro.</description>

      <description>Not much to trade today. There is lots of red on the board; however at 8AM nothing is down significantly, so we wait.
The Fed ends day 2 of the FOMC meeting. My expectation is that Powell makes a statement that says they are still not worried about inflation, which will send shockwaves across all markets. The 10y will rise more than it has already (currently it is at 1.66%), crypto and equities will sell off.</description>

      <description>I have decided to start posting the trades I think are interesting to my site. This is not investment advice, so do with it as you wish and take it what it is for.
Today I have my eye on a two cryptos.
UNIUSDT
UNI has tumbled 14.5% since the 13th on the 4h time frame. MarketCipher B shows a green dot, and while not a glowing green dot, on this time frame it should not be ignored.</description>
