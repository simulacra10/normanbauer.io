      <description>The new broke to me about three days ago that Mozilla has finally thrown their hat into the VPN ring. Yea!!!!
A few years ago Mozilla found itself in the unique position as the only alternative browser to Google Chrome other then Apple&amp;rsquo;s Safari. Opera had dropped their rendering engine in 2013 (Called Presto) in favor of Google Chrome&amp;rsquo;s Blink rendering engine. Internet Explorer was abandoned by Microsoft and rebuilt from scratch with Google Chrome&amp;rsquo;s Blink and rebranded as Edge.</description>

      <description>Here is the first post. I am leaving this as a sample and do not intend to get rid of it.
This site is a work in progress. It is meant for my pleasure and to server whatever ends I think are needed. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably find topics that range from libertarianism to technology and all things inbetween.</description>
