      <title>Term Limits? No!</title>

      <description>The post Omnibus Spending Bill fallout has the left and the right both justified and united in their anger at Congress. This righteous anger has again created new calls for term limits. While I am sympathetic to the call, I also have to oppose such calls. I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to explain why term limits are not a fix and will only make the problem worse and I will offer two options that will actually change things and go a long way to restoring the true idea of governance that was and is still unique to the US.</description>

      <title>Facebook OG Tags</title>

      <description>Facebook introduced the [https://ogp.me](Open Graph) format however long ago it was, I am not sure. For me, as a website developer and content creator, the OG format is always one of those things I forget about until I&amp;rsquo;ve published the site and go to share the first post (note to self to add that to the check list). When Facebook does not parse my content I get my sad face on because yet again I have forgotten to add the OG tags.</description>

      <title>Another Google Purge</title>
      <link>https://normanbauer.io/post/another-google-purge/</link>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not clear to me who is running Google anymore. Google has decided to purge two programming language groups. comp.lang.forth &amp;amp; comp.lang.lisp
Of importance to me is the purge of Lisp. Lisp is one of the oldest programming languages. My favorite editor Emacs is written in a fork of Lisp (elisp). Contrary to what the twenty somethings at Google may think, lisp is still used today. However more important than the fact that it is still used is the historical value the threads themselves provide.</description>

      <description>The chart below is produced using the numbers from The St Louis Federal Reserve Bank. They are in charge of reporting on the money supply.
On March 16, 2020 the M2 stock was 15,726 billion USD.
As of July 27th, 2020 the M2 stock was 18286 billion USD.
That represents a 14% increase in the money supply in a matter of 4 months.

      <description>The new broke to me about three days ago that Mozilla has finally thrown their hat into the VPN ring. Yea!!!!
A few years ago Mozilla found itself in the unique position as the only alternative browser to Google Chrome other then Apple&amp;rsquo;s Safari. Opera had dropped their rendering engine in 2013 (Called Presto) in favor of Google Chrome&amp;rsquo;s Blink rendering engine. Internet Explorer was abandoned by Microsoft and rebuilt from scratch with Google Chrome&amp;rsquo;s Blink and rebranded as Edge.</description>

      <description>I recently had my first radio interview and I hope it is not the last. Given that, I thought it would be a good idea to keep a running tally.
  July 22, 2020 - Colorado Front Range Hour on 1360khnc.com The Roar of The Rockies. Hosts Jason, Bryan, Glen have me on to discuss the Portland Protests and Constitutionality of federal police. Click here to listen to the interview.</description>

      <description>Here is the first post. I am leaving this as a sample and do not intend to get rid of it.
This site is a work in progress. It is meant for my pleasure and to server whatever ends I think are needed. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably find topics that range from libertarianism to technology and all things inbetween.</description>
